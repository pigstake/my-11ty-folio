Visualize work data to help distributed sales teams work smarter and happier.

Badger is a performance feedback mobile app. How can personal data help remote salespeople or their teams...or their managers? And how could my team alleviate the mistrust in how managers could use this data? I led design and research on this product at Philosophie for our client. We were a team of five â€” three engineers, myself, and a product manager.

My contribution: Design, Research, Front-end Code

## Key design decisions
The sales team already received weekly reports, so I tailored the Badger experience to fit into this existing behavior. Graphs, performance summaries, and a notification schedule were designed around familiar work rhythms.

Bright colors and slightly informal typography provide a memorable experience among the usual apps our users have at work. The app uses Libre Franklin, which is versatile enough to make big numbers and small fonts look good.

I moderated user interviews while my product manager and two engineers noted observations. We organized our notes together to share insights.

## The impact
My team learned early on through user interviews that people had trust issues exposing their performance data. Week after week, changes in copy and color helped alleviate this. Over six months, Badger users at a cable company outperformed their peers by 17%.
