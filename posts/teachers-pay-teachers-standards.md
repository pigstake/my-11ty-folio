  <h3>Teachers struggled to find the right content</h3>
  <p>Teachers Pay Teachers (TPT) is a two-sided marketplace for teachers to buy and sell materials. A few months before I joined, TPT launched a B2B service, selling subscriptions to schools. These schools must meet specific curriculum standards. Teachers, in turn, must use teaching materials that meet those curriculum standards.</p>
  <p>Teachers struggled to find the right content, though. This was an impactful and urgent opportunity that I helped define, design, and iterate on.</p>

  <h3>Defining opportunities, solutions, and experiments</h3>
  <p>Inspired by Teresa Torres, I suggested to my product manager that we use an opportunity solution tree. He was excited to try, and I helped manage it — especially the solutions and experiments, which tended to be more my responsibility as a senior product designer. This particular teacher problem was one of many opportunities. From that map, the product manager, engineer lead, and I prioritized potential solutions for this opportunity. I facilitated workshops to help the team visualize these possibilities, so we could better decide and move forward together. I provided an overview and hub for the team in Figma that helped us stay focused on one opportunity at a time, which you can see here.</p>

  <h4>Staying on brand and pushing our design system forward</h4>
  <p>We had brand guidelines and a design system that helped with a lot of the interface decisions. TPT had never built a product with search autosuggest, though. The filters and information density on cards that I designed also required updates to the design system. As I explored these designs in the sprint work, I had the chance to work in parallel with other designers to introduce these patterns to the broader design system. Other TPT tools rolled out the new search autosuggest and filters that I designed, too.</p>

  <h4>Running experiments and applying research insights</h4>
  <p>I defined research goals and facilitated user interviews for both generative and evaluative studies. Alongside a dedicated UX researcher and my product manager, I ran small sample size studies every two weeks. Funnel data and multivariate tests helped us iterate after launch. We learned that teachers felt anxious about overly specifying their searches, behavior they learned from previous TPT interactions. My research was critical in understanding how to help teachers best use these new search and filter tools and guide them away from old behaviors and mental models.</p>

<h4>Communicating with engineers and sequencing launch</h4>
  <p>I prefer to work with engineers in code on the UI, but my team didn’t work that way. So I made a combination of prototypes and light documentation in Figma to communicate design decisions for UI states, timing, and motion.</p>
  <p>I organized the concepts into fully functional slices that we could launch and learn from in smaller batches. This allowed us to improve every subsequent feature with what we learned from the earlier small batches.</p>
