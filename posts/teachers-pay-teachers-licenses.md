<h3>Customer problem and business outcome</h3>
<p>Teachers Pay Teachers (TPT) is a two-sided marketplace for teachers to buy and sell materials. A few months before I joined, TPT launched a B2B service, selling subscriptions to schools. These schools pay to access content and, in turn, provide content licenses to teachers. Thanks to this subscription, teachers don't have to pay out-of-pocket for as much teaching content.</p>
<p>One major problem, though, was that TPT account managers managed licenses for school admins. This process was a major pain point for teachers, administrators, and account managers. It made it difficult for teacher's to use the materials they needed on TPT. I designed and helped launch the first tools that admins could use to distribute content licenses to teachers. These tools improved customer acquisition and retention.</p>

<h3>Work artifacts</h3>
<h4>Our team hub, a design single source of truth in Figma</h4>
<p>The product manager and I managed an opportunity solution tree across our product scope. From that map, we prioritized potential solutions for this opportunity with other teammates. I facilitated workshops to help the team visualize these possibilities, so we could better decide and move forward together. I provided an overview and hub for the team in Figma that helped us stay focused, which you can see here. </p>

<h4>User flows and writing the interface</h4>
<p>Two of my favorite tools to explore design possibilities are user flows and a technique I call “writing the interface,” in which someone writes possible content and actions on a screen-like space. With my TPT team, I led collaborative exercises in these techniques: the product manager, researcher, and engineers I worked with quickly drew user flows and wrote the interface with me so we could explore concepts quickly together.</p>
