  <p>I hit the ground running on this project, my first at Ridwell. Leadership had already defined a new subscription model they planned to launch to ~90,000 customers in four months. I spoke with co-founders, customer success specialists, engineers, and customers. I tore down the existing designs with heuristic evaluation. All this helped me understand what Ridwell customers experienced with the existing service, how to improve design quality, and what business stakeholders hoped to achieve. Diagrams like the one above, with flows, screenshots, and my critical notes helped me craft a vision for how to shape the new subscription model with care for both business and customer needs.</p>

  <h3>Exploring how to present the new subscription model</h3>
  <ul>
    <p>Leading up to launch, my work involved:
      <li>Reviewing existing interaction patterns for inspiration</li>
      <li>Translating a recent mobile UI design system into responsive web app patterns</li>
      <li>Regular coordination with engineers and a product manager (sprint planning, pairing sessions, retrospectives)</li>
      <li>Evaluative UX research to increase our confidence in concepts and remove potential usability boulders from our soon-to-be customer experience</li>
    </p>
  </ul>

    <h4>Design challenges and decisions</h4>
    <p>Prototypes, research, teammate feedback, inspiration, and intuition guided my decisions on how to structure content and navigation that affords Ridwell leads to make a clear decision easily. Some of the leadership team expressed anxiety about the experience overwhelming people and feeling too transactional. Since the company had started as a community service between neighbors, the vision for how how people sign up for Ridwell held true to a personable, community member tone. Because of this, I decided to limit information density in both how we lay out content and by separating account creation and checkout into separate steps. I also decided to present the plans as cards, instead of a table, to provide a visual metaphor of something tangible rather than purely analytical.</p>

    <p>Redesigning the subscription experience using a new visual language provided opportunities to improve accessibility and maintainability in the codebase.</p>

  <h3>Launch and beyond</h3>
  <ul>
    <p>After launch, my work involved:
      <li>Tracking user experience via funnels to identify major opportunities to optimize</li>
      <li>Running research studies to gather qualitative insight into major opportunities</li>
      <li>Working with product management, marketing, engineering, and customer success to define experiments to improve the subscription experience</li>
    </p>
  </ul>

  <h4>Iteration challenges and decisions</h4>
  <p>A ha! A few weeks after launch, thanks to user interviews I facilitated, we learned that people want to know how big the Ridwell bin is and how easy it is to change or cancel their plan after they sign up. My product manager and a co-founder expressed concern about telling people how easy it is to cancel. Won’t this reduce retention? They were attracted to the idea of making it difficult to cancel, of obfuscating this information. Given my research, and examples of subscription services that make a benefit of easy plan switching, pausing, or canceling, I convinced the team to test out a low-effort solution. We added a few lines of copy. Customer retention didn’t drop at all, and subscription conversion steadily increased in the next several months.</p>

  <h4>Reflecting on the process</h4>
  <p> The process wasn’t perfect. We could have launched with more focus on craft if we had more upfront strategic shaping. In our fixed 12-week timeline, I needed to run research to help leadership agree on a major decision: to ask for an address instead of a zip code for specific prices. The marketing team feared the increased sign-up friction if we asked for an address. The product team wanted to experiment with a new interaction that provided accurate prices as early as possible. Neither team seemed ready to disagree and commit.</p>
  <p>If this had been shaped earlier, I could have spent two more weeks translating the recent mobile visual language into the web app, and evaluating design quality before launch. As a result, the UI quality at launch suffered; we had to compromise on updates to typography, colors, and components.</p>
  <p>In hindsight, my mistake had been to suggest the upfront research as a means to help build alignment. After launch, I eventually ran an A/B test to compare the impact of address and zip code entry on sign-up conversion. I had advocated for shipping to learn before launch, because I generally believe this to be good practice for software teams. Without my upfront research, the team would have had to disagree and commit — probably to the same decision. The team would have exercised a valuable process muscle, and more customers might have signed up thanks to more attention to design details.</p>

  <p class="quote"><q>This required thoughtful user research, stakeholder management, and expert product design to transition the members and the business toward a new way of thinking about our product. Not only did our members successfully transition to these new plans, but the project drove a $4.50 (33%) increase in average revenue per user putting Ridwell in better position for future profitability and fundraising.</q></p>
