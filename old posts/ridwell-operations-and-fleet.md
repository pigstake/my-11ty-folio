<h3>Customer problem and business outcome</h3>
<p>Teachers Pay Teachers (TPT) is a two-sided marketplace for teachers to buy and sell materials. A few months before I joined, TPT launched a B2B service, selling subscriptions to schools. These schools must meet specific curriculum standards. Teachers, in turn, must use teaching materials that meet those curriculum standards.</p>
<p>Teachers struggled to find the right content, though. This was an impactful and urgent opportunity that I helped define with research. Before the new school year started, I designed and helped launch major redesigns to the search and discovery experience. This new teacher experience helped improve B2B acquisition and retention.</p>

<h3>Work artifacts</h3>
<h4>Mapping solutions to our target opportunity</h4>
<p>The product manager and I managed an opportunity solution tree across our product scope. From that map, we prioritized potential solutions for this opportunity with other teammates. I facilitated workshops to help the team visualize these possibilities, so we could better decide and move forward together. I provided an overview and hub for the team in Figma that helped us stay focused, which you can see here. </p>

<h4>Running experiments and applying research insights</h4>
<p>I defined research goals and facilitated user interviews for both generative and evaluative studies. We ran small sample size studies every two weeks. I also analyzed funnel data and planned multivariate tests.</p>
