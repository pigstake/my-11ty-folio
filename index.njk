  <p>Hi, I’m Jamie. In my design practice, I value deep listening, adapting to context, accessibility, a sense of play, and a bias towards shipping to learn from people who use what I build.</p>
  <p>I lead product design efforts at Ridwell, where I help reduce landfill waste through the digital experiences of our customers and our operations team. Before this, I managed 10 product designers at the product consultancy Philosophie, doubling the team size through inclusive hiring and career development.</p>

    <h2>I build trust <br>and pull teams forward.</h2>
      <p>Engineers, product managers, marketers, support specialists, other designers, and more — my teammates across dozens of disciplines say I have a talent for building trust. Part of this talent is thanks to my research practice, which helps me listen with as little bias and prejudice as I’m consciously capable of. Aligning what I hear with my teammate’s intentions allows me to draw meaningful insights to act upon. And then when I promise to act, I follow through.</p>
      <p>Oh, and I’m also quite skilled at writing copy, writing maintainable CSS, setting typography, building an accessible color palette that evokes the right tone, and such design things.</p>

    <p class="quote"><q>Above all, I was impressed with Jamie's ability to go into a room and represent design fully, both as a consultant and as a teacher for the younger designers. Jamie would be a true asset for any positions requiring design leadership and comes with my heartfelt recommendation.</q></p>
