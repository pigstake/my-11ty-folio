  <p>Hi, I’m Jamie. In my design practice, I value listening, adapting to context, accessibility, ethical constraints, and a sense of play.</p>
  <p>I mentor students enrolled in the UX/UI course at Springboard. Recently, I managed 10 product designers at the product consultancy Philosophie, doubling the team size through inclusive hiring and career development.</p>

    <h2>I build trust <br>and pull teams forward.</h2>
      <p>My teams say I have a talent for building trust. Part of this talent is from my UX practice, which helps me listen like a researcher. And then when I promise to act, I follow through.</p>

  <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
  <p>I build this site with <a href='https://www.11ty.dev/'>11ty</a>, my own fingers, flights of motivation, a bottomless cup of tea, emergent chaos, barefoot, sitting on my green rug, and listening <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIMNXogXnvE'>to music</a>.</p>
