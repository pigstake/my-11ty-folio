  <p>Some things about me and, I dunno, my mindset or perspective on work. Maybe two sentences. Maybe three. A few lines of details I think, depending on the story I want to tell.</p>

#   <h5>Design Leadership</h5>
#   <h2>My intentions as a leader are to build trust and to practice what I believe.</h2>
#   <p>Building trust with both designers I manage and other leaders requires me to listen. I draw from my UX research experience for this; I want to understand your goals and experience when I work with you. Trust also requires me to act, to follow through in the ways I can help you. If I don't listen, you won't trust me; if I listen and never take action, your might trust me a little. If I listen, define ways I can help and offer to take action, and then follow through with that promise, then we're building trust.</p>
#   <p>I believe that teammates rise to the level of their environment. So, I set my teams up for success. I clarify expectations and build structures that help designers and their teams succeed. <b>ADD CONCRETE</b></li>
